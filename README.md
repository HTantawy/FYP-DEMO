# üìö Intelligent Student-Supervisor Matcher Web-Application

This is a web-based allocation system that uses NLP and semantic similarity techniques to match students with the most suitable supervisors based on project proposals, research interests, and technical compatibility. The system integrates BERT, SBERT, TF-IDF, and a custom scoring algorithm, all deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## üöÄ Features

- AI-powered matching using BERT + SBERT + TF-IDF
-  Role-based dashboards for students, supervisors, and admins
-  Secure authentication using hashed passwords (bcrypt)
-  Admin dashboard for overseeing matches, reassignments, and exports
-  Messaging and supervision request features
-  Integrated Chatbot for project proposal guidance using OpenAI's API
-  Export functionality (PDF and CSV)
